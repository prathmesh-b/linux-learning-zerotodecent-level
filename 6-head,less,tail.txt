Exploring Head, Tail, and Less Commands

if we want to read the smaller part of file instead of full big file

head and tail command

head is use to see starting character of file

1) head fruits.txt

it gives starting 10 elements

2) tails fruits.txt

it gives starting 10 elements

mostly tails is being used to check latest ending

3) -f 
it follows check output continuosly mostly used in software to see if anyone doing changes or working on file

this is applied at end lines of file to see changes
eg tail -f apple.txt

it shows continusly blinking dot which says someone is changing
to exit the this press Cltrl + C

4) less
cat command prints the whole output but less print page wise output so that you easily move and view

this also prints on new window and not on terminal which looks clean after this

q - quit the viewing result
/ - to search result in the file
