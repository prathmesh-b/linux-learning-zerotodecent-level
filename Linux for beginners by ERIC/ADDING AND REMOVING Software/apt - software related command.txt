You’ll often need to install software that didn’t come with your distribution or remove unwanted software so it doesn’t take up hard drive space.

Some software requires other software to run, and you’ll sometimes find
that you can download everything you need at once in a software package,
which is a group of files—typically libraries and other dependencies—that
you need for a piece of software to run successfully.

apt command - Advanced Packaging Tool/apt

use apt to download and install new software packages, but you can also
apt update and upgrade software with it.

=== searching for software package ===
Before downloading a software package, you can check whether the
package you need is available from your repository, which is a place where
your operating system stores information.

sudo apt search keyword

=== installing software/adding software ===
To install a piece of software from your operating system's default repository in terminal.

sudo apt install packagename/software name


=== Removing Software/Uninstall software ===

To remove software 

sudo apt remove packagename


===Updating Packages===
Updating isn’t the same as upgrading: updating simply
updates the list of packages available for download from the repository,
whereas upgrading upgrades the package to the latest version in the
repository.

You can update your individual system by entering the
command
apt
followed by the keyword update. This will search through all the packages
on your system and check whether updates are available. If so, the updates
are downloaded.

sudo apt update

The list of available software in the repository on your system will be
updated. If the update is successful, your terminal will state Reading package
lists... Done.

=== Upgrading currently installed softwares in system ===
to get latest version of currently using software. or upgrade to latest version use command

sudo apt upgrade

it upgrade all software in system apt knows about, meaning only those stored in the repository.

=== Adding Repositories to Your sources.list File ===
The servers that hold the software for particular distributions of Linux are
known as repositories. Nearly every distribution has its own repositories of
software—developed and configured for that distribution—that might not
work well, or at all, with other distributions.

Kali specializes in securityand hacking, it doesn’t include some specialty software and tools or even some run-of-the-mill software. It’s worth adding a backup repository that your system can search through in case it doesn’t find specific software in the Kali repository.

The repositories your system will search for software are stored in the
sources.list file, and you can alter this file to define from which repositories
you want to download software. I often add the Ubuntu repositories after
the Kali repositories in my sources.list file; that way, when I request to
download a new software package, if it isn’t in the Kali repository, my
system may find it in the Ubuntu repository.

You can find the sources.list file at /etc/apt/sources.list and open it with any
text editor.

When you ask to download a new software package, the system looks
through the repositories listed in sources.list and selects the most recent
version of the desired package.check whether software is comptatible with your system or not. mostly popular like kali or ubuntu based on debian so not issue.

add this to source file for kali user

=== Installing Software with git ===
Sometimes the software you want isn’t available in any of the repositories
—especially if it’s brand new—but it may be available on GitHub. u can install from there

git clone url of software from github repo

eg git clone https://github.com/Ullaakut/cameradar
this download required files from github to your system.
