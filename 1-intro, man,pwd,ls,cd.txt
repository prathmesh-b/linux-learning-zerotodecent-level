Don't remember any command use man command to understand and become better at Linux

command = command name + options + arguments


Here's a breakdown: 

• Command: The primary instruction you want the system to execute. For example, ls, mkdir, cp, rm. 
• Arguments: The data or parameters that accompany the command. These can be: 
	• Options/Flags: These usually begin with a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--) and modify the command's default behavior. For example, in ls -l, -l is an option that tells ls to display a long listing format. In mkdir -p, -p is an option that tells mkdir to create parent directories as needed. 
	• Positional Arguments: These are typically file or directory names, or other specific values that the command needs to operate on. For example, in cp file1.txt /home/user/documents, file1.txt and /home/user/documents are positional arguments specifying the source and destination for the copy operation. In mkdir new_directory, new_directory is a positional argument specifying the name of the directory to be created. 

Example: 
cp -r /home/user/documents /backup/documents_backup

In this example: 

• cp is the command (for copying files and directories). 
• -r is an option (for recursive copying, necessary when copying directories). 
• /home/user/documents is a positional argument (the source directory). 
• /backup/documents_backup is another positional argument (the destination directory). 


options are case sensitive
options can be combined
option short form :cat -n abc.txt
option long form :cat --number abc.txt

#man command - it is used as document say suppose you don't know what comes with cat command.
just type: 
          man cat
and it will open manual page docs instruction for this command. use up down arrow key to move and view pages.



#Understanding man

man cp

cp- copy files and directores(folder)

Synopsis cp [Option]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY

here [Option] means you can use say -a archieve with cp. cp [Option] like this cp -a 

... it means multiple options , sources you can give


#pwd - print working directory / show current path of folder

command - pwd
this is used to check where is our current location/path

#ls - list files inside dir/folder

show content of folder and folder colour will be different and files colour will be different

command ls -a

it shows hidden files also which start with .local   .ssh etc 

when you do ls the result will show . and .. here . show current and .. to go back
so when you type 
command -
cd ..
it take back to previous location say your current pwd is c/home/video then after cd .. it goes back c/home

command ls -l
this shows full details eg

-h this command can help you to read output in humanread form

command: ls -a -l -h
you can also write togeter which output same

command: ls -alh  which equals to ls -a -l -h

you can practice different command by going to man command: man ls and practicing




#root directory/parent dir 
this is very first beginning or root from which all directores start and it indicated by " / "

so if you type command: cd /
it will take you to root then you find out using pwd and ls -l -h to see which directores are there 
example -- 


linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ cd /

Also here there is one user linuxofpratham inside home because only 1 user is using so if another user name ram come then two users will be shown

# movement command to reach folder 

command : cd cloudcomputing   this is called relative path
 or   
command : cd /home/linuxofpratham/cloudcomputing    this is called absolute path
