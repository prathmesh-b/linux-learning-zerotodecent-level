30ot.txt   b  codecloud       linux_for_cloud  newday  newfile.txt.save  shortcut2of_naramlinkfile

~$ rm -r -d gyab
~$ ls
30oct.txt  a  cloudcomputing  linux_for_cloud  newday       newfile.txt.save      shortcut2of_naramlinkfile
30ot.txt   b  codecloud       movies           newfile.txt  newfileforoutput.txt

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/movies$ cd ..
