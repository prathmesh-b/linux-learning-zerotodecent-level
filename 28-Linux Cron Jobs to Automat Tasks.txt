this command open that crontab file and choose nano 1 number if asked
-e means here editing crontab file

========= syntax=====
***** command_to_be_executed

1st character * represent Minute (0 - 59)
2nd character * represent Hour (0 - 23)
3rd character * represent Day of month (1 - 31)

for eg */5 in the minute field means every 5 minutes.

let's say we want to run file morning at 3:30 am 
30 3 ***

the command will run every day at 3:30 AM. 

The five fields in a cron expression represent the following:
Field 	Meaning	          Allowed Values	Your Value
1st	Minute	            0 - 59	          30
2nd	Hour             (24-hour format)	0 - 23	3
3rd	Day of Month      	1 - 31	         * (any)
4th	Month	         1 - 12 (or names)	  * (any)
5th	Day of Week	 0 - 6 (Sunday=0 or 7)	 * (any)

Breakdown of 30 3 * * *
30 in the minute field: Specifies the 30th minute of the hour.
3 in the hour field: Specifies the 3rd hour, which is 3:00 AM.
* in the day of month, month, and day of week fields: These wildcards mean the task will run regardless of the day of the month, the month, or the day of the week. 


we want every 3 30 am to print hello in hello.log file 
 30 3 *** echo "hello" >> ~/hello.log           so in the crontab file added this.


--- quick example testing ----

***** echo "hello" >> ~/hello.log

above not worked but i don changes

* * * * * /bin/echo "hello" >> /home/linuxofpratham/crondir/hello.log

between * * need spaces so that 5 stars not count as 1 star

so the hello wil be printed every min and log file is created in crondir

$ crontab -e
crontab: installing new crontab

this will be shown after u saved file because crontab background process runs which checks command to run from file


15 13 * * 1

this means 1 15 pm afternoon evry monday code will be run


0 * 5 * *
code will run 5th of month every hr at 0th minute

-------------
0 0 */2 * *
*/2 means every two day at night 12 pm 00 . code will be execute

so let's say now it run at time of 12pm then after 48 hr it will run again

-----------
45 4 * 1,2 0

Runs at 04:45 AM on Sundays in January and February every minute

every sunday 4 45 am of every1,2nd month of year

1,2 means range of month 1 for jan 2 for feb


-----------
30 8 * * 1-5 

1-5 give range from 1 to 5 only

from mon to fri 8 30 am every min and every hour 


linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/crondir$ cat hello.log
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello
hello

this hello printed in log file $ cat hello.log this says previous command is working from ecron file 


==== the real use case is say sometimes say high speed net will be flown for sepcific hr/ data consumed then macaddress will be changed via this crom feature .

but be cautions is it legal or not ====
