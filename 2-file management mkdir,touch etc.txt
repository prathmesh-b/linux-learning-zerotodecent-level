Linux filemanagement

to move to home dir which is starting point

ls ~

u will move to home dir even if you are anywhere

1) mkdir
you can create folders multiple or single 

eg mkdir movie
 cd movie
result--
mkdir horror action thriller

== To create folder inside folder
if you do this mkdir kids/animation it will not work
do this
command: mkdir -p kids/animation
so -p tells parent folder 
kids parent folder
animation child foler


2) touch

touch command can be used to create file

touch hello.html 

also multiple files

touch hello.html bye.txt

3)file
file command tells the file type

also if you write txt in .mp4 the file type will not accept it. the linux do some test to determine file type. you can't fool it.

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ file 30oct.txt
30oct.txt: ASCII text

== tip ==
when you create file or anything
file a b this cmd consider a and b as separate file
file 'a' this says consider as one file when it goes into ' ' quotation
