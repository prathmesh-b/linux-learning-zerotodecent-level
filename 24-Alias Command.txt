The Linux alias command creates a user-defined shortcut for a longer command or sequence of commands, which simplifies command-line usage and saves typing. 

How to Use the alias Command
The basic syntax for creating an alias is:

alias shortcut_name='the original command to run'

Quotes are generally required if the command contains spaces or special characters. There should be no space immediately before or after the equals sign (=). 

Creating Aliases
Temporary Aliases: An alias defined directly in the terminal only lasts for the current session. It will disappear when the terminal is closed.
Example: alias ll='ls -la'
Permanent Aliases: To make an alias persist across sessions, you must add it to your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc for Bash or ~/.zshrc for Zsh).
Open the configuration file using a text editor, such as nano ~/.bashrc.
Add your alias command to the end of the file.
Save the file and exit the editor.
Apply the changes to your current session by running source ~/.bashrc (or the relevant file for your shell). 

Managing Aliases
List all current aliases: Run the alias command without any arguments.
Remove a specific alias: Use the unalias command followed by the alias name.
Example: unalias ll
Remove all aliases in the current session: Use the unalias -a option. 

Practical Examples
Here are a few useful aliases you can add to your configuration file: 
Alias 	Command	Description
ll	ls -la	Lists all files in a directory in a detailed format.
update	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade	Updates package lists and installs upgrades (for Debian-based systems).
home	cd ~	Navigates directly to the home directory.
rm	rm -i	Asks for confirmation before deleting files, enhancing safety.
gst	git status	A shortcut for checking Git repository status.

Note on Functions
For more complex scenarios, especially when you need to pass arguments to different parts of a command, shell functions are generally recommended over aliases as they offer more flexibility. 



type command helps to determine type of command

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ type pwd
pwd is a shell builtin

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ type echo
echo is a shell builtin

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ type cat
cat is /usr/bin/cat
this is binary command

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ type ls
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'

 ls
30ot.txt                   citrus.txt        gracias.txt      movies                orange.txt            rootfoldertest
abc.txt                    cloudcomputing    hello.txt        newday


so when i type ls the actual command run behind scene is `ls --color=auto'


how to create shortcut for our own work when we do particular type daily repeat. 
eg u created quote.txt file in doucment dir to start ur day fresh. but opening documents and then file and read so much steps but 
you can create short cut for it.

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/newday$ ls
newdayfile.txt  quotes.txt

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/newday$ cd
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ cat newday/quotes.txt
1. every day is new chance to reach closer towards goal even if your previous day not go as well.
2. Just don't stop or change direcion of your goal because of new shiny things.

let's create alias for it to read quotes with simple command

with below command u can read .bashrc file which has existing alias
ratham:~$ cat .bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# If not running interactively, don't do anything
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
      *) return;;
esac


====lets create alias for quotes==


linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ alias quotes='cat ~/newday/quotes.txt'
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ quotes
1. every day is new chance to reach closer towards goal even if your previous day not go as well.
2. Just don't stop or change direcion of your goal because of new shiny things.


this command run only in current session but we want it to run permanent so where to write
so we want to add this into .bashrc file 

~$ nano .bashrc

added at last this txt
alias quotes='cat ~/newday/quotes.txt'

so u can save program in .bashrc file and which need very frequent repeatly which u can
save as alias

whenever u create new alias save it in .bash_aliases which consist personal alias instead of adding to .bashrc file system

that code will run when typed shortcut. code is called binary in terms of linux.
In Linux, the term "binary" most commonly refers to executable files containing compiled machine code that the computer's processor can run directly. These files are not human-readable text but a sequence of bytes (0s and 1s) representing instructions. 

Key Concepts
Machine Code: Source code written by programmers in languages like C or C++ is translated into machine code by a compiler. This resulting file is the "binary".

Executable vs. Binary: The terms are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings.
Binary file: Strictly speaking, any file that is not plain, human-readable text (images, audio, compressed archives, compiled libraries, etc.) is a binary file.

Executable file: A file that the operating system can run as a program. This can be a binary file (compiled machine code) or a text file (a script with a "shebang" line, like #!/bin/bash) that invokes an interpreter.

In common Linux parlance, "a binary" usually means a binary executable file.

File Format: Linux binaries typically use the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).
Platform Specificity: Binaries are compiled for a specific hardware architecture and operating system combination. A binary compiled for Linux generally cannot run on Windows or macOS without a compatibility layer or re-compilation. 

Binary Directories in the Linux Filesystem
Binaries are stored in specific directories following the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). 
/bin: Contains essential user command binaries required for basic system function, available to all users (e.g., ls, cp, mv, cat).
/sbin: Contains system binaries, primarily for system administration and maintenance tasks (e.g., ifconfig, fdisk, shutdown). These typically require root privileges to execute.
/usr/bin: Contains most user-level executable programs.
/usr/sbin: Contains more system administration binaries that are not strictly essential for the system to boot or run in single-user mode.
/lib and /usr/lib: These directories hold shared libraries that the binaries in /bin and /usr/bin need to function.
