27- Linux Scripts: Essential Tips for Beginners and Advanced Users

LInux scripts are like put multiple commands in one file and run that script

What is script? 
A script in Linux, generally referred to as a shell script, is a text file containing a sequence of commands for the shell (command-line interpreter) to execute. The shell runs these commands in the order they appear, just as if you had typed them manually at the command line. 

Shell scripts are a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks, combining multiple commands, and streamlining complex procedures, which saves time and reduces human errors. 

Key Concepts
Automation: The primary purpose of a shell script is automation, such as routine backups, system monitoring, or software installation processes.
Shell as Interpreter: The shell (e.g., Bash, sh, Zsh) is a program that provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system kernel. When a script runs, the shell interprets and executes the commands within it.

Programming Constructs: Unlike simple batch files, shell scripts incorporate features found in many programming languages, including:
Variables (to store data)
Control flow (if/else statements, case)
Loops (for, while)
Functions (groups of commands that can be called by name)

Shebang: Most scripts start with a special line called the "shebang" (e.g., #!/bin/bash), which tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script. 

The script Command
Separately, Linux also has a specific command named script. This command is used to record an entire interactive terminal session (all inputs and outputs) into a file (by default named typescript). This is useful for creating logs, documenting procedures, or educational demonstrations. 

How to Create and Run a Shell Script
Create the file: Use a text editor like nano or vim to create a file, often with a .sh extension (though not strictly necessary).

Add the shebang and commands:
bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
# The above command prints "Hello World!" to the terminal

Make it executable: Change the file's permissions using the chmod command:
bash
chmod +x your_script.sh

Run the script: Execute the script using its path:
bash
./your_script.sh

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

So script helps to run 100 lines of code work with just one command. 

Shebang: Most scripts start with a special line called the "shebang" (e.g., #!/bin/bash), which tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script. regardless of file extension. this allows you to name your scripts with or without a .sh extension.


so your script programm should have written inside begin with

#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"

how to run this 

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/bin$ bash hi
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham

--- How to execute ----
Save script like 

1) bash myFirstScript
2) sh myFirstScript
3) source myFirstScript
4) ./myFirstScript


bash myFirstScript  - This explicitly tells the bash shell to execute the script. It's commonly used for bash scripts.


sh myFirstScript
This instructs the system to use the default shell
-------------------
source myFirstScript
This runs the script in the current shell session instead of spawning a new process. it's often used to execute scripts that modify the environment, such as setting environment variables.

------------------
./myFirstScript
Requires the script to be made executable

If the file is found and has execute permission, the shell executes it using the appropriate interpreter specified in the shebang line.

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/bin$ ls -l| grep hi
-rw-r--r-- 1 linuxofpratham pratham 95 Dec 15 15:17 hi
above x permission was not there so ./hi don't run after givening permission it run

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/bin$  ./hi
-bash: ./hi: Permission denied

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/bin$ chmod +x hi
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~/bin$  ./hi
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham
Hi linuxofpratham

-------------------
giving absolute path also run the script
eg home/username/hi

/home/username/myFirstScript

Even though you're not explicitly providing the script file to a command like cat or echo,
you're instructing the shell to execute the script at the given absolute path. the shell takes care of locating the file and using the correct interpreter to run it.
-- why this many---
so bash and sh run scripts in subshell and which not affect parent shell. source affects current shell environment only if any changes or programm that only works for this session.


----
what if you want to run a script as if it were a command, without specifying the path to the script every time

so we want script to take as command when we write it should not through error like "command not found"
So need to add the Script to a Directory in the PATH
