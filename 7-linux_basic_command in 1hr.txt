=== how to login as root user ===
su -

type password

if authentication failed it maybe due to wrong password

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ su -
Password:
su: Authentication failure
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ su -

The su: Authentication failure error occurs when the password entered for the target user (by default, the root user) is incorrect, or if the root account is disabled or improperly configured on your system. 

Common Causes and Solutions
Here are the most common reasons for this error and how to address them:

1. Incorrect Password
The most frequent cause is simply typing the wrong password. 
Solution: Double-check the password for the root user. Note that when you type a password in the terminal, nothing appears on the screen (no asterisks or dots); this is a security feature. 

2. Root Account is Disabled by Default (Common in Ubuntu/Debian) 
Many Linux distributions, like Ubuntu, disable the root account by default and do not set a password for it. In such systems, the su - command will fail because there is no valid root password to use. 

Solution 1 (Recommended): Use sudo instead of su
To run commands with administrative privileges, use sudo followed by the command. You will be prompted for your own user's password, not the root password.
To get a root shell (an interactive session as the root user), use sudo -i or sudo su.

i used su -i and i gone to root terminal because i am using wsl2

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for linuxofpratham:

root@Pratham:~# pwd
/root

so here root user is superadmin which can create/perform operation at admin level and now he will create file in linuxofpratham user


root@Pratham:~# cd /home/linuxofpratham
root@Pratham:/home/linuxofpratham# ls
30oct.txt  apple.txt   cloudcomputing  fruits.txt       movies  newfile.txt       newfileforoutput.txt  shortcut2of_naramlinkfile
30ot.txt   citrus.txt  codecloud       linux_for_cloud  newday  newfile.txt.save  orange.txt
root@Pratham:/home/linuxofpratham# touch newroot.txt
root@Pratham:/home/linuxofpratham# nano newroot.txt
root@Pratham:/home/linuxofpratham# ls -ltr

did u see last line root mentioned and -rw-r--r it shows root can read,write and other only read -r--r 


== let's exit from root mode ===
write exit

and u switchback to user login

when i opened file using cat

==== how to open file ====
cat filename

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ cat newroot.txt
i am created by root user permission. the super user who has all permission has created this file in linuxofpratham user

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ nano newroot.txt
this below is shown


-- writen inside file --

 root user permission. the super user who has all permission has created this file in linuxofpratham user

 [ File 'newroot.txt' is unwritable ]

-- writen inside file --

=== 2nd way apart from cat to open file ===
less filename

it open files in separate win if it is very big and it not hang terminal

to exit :wq

=== wordcount cmd ===
this tells wordcount

 wc newroot.txt
  1  21 122 newroot.txt
1- line
21 - words
122 byte/character


=== how to check difference between files ===
diff filename1 filename2

it shows by line by line difference



=== compressing and decompressing file ===
suppose you want to send the file so u first compress it

tar cvf files.tar file1 file2

tar cvf is option and files.tar is package name and files u want to compress


 tar cvf fruitszipped.tar apple.txt citrus.txt
apple.txt
citrus.txt

:~$ ls
30oct.txt  citrus.txt   fruits.txt    movies fruitszipped.tar  

so here two files have become single packaged name fruitszipped.tar

== in order to make zip file use gzip ==
.tar extension files
gzip package name

:gzip fruitszipped.tar

:~$ ls
30oct.txt  citrus.txt      fruits.txt           movies       newfile.txt.save      orange.txt
30ot.txt   cloudcomputing  fruitszipped.tar.gz


.tar filesize is big and
.tar.gz filesize is low


=== how to unzip ===

 gunzip fruitszipped.tar.gz

this convert package into .tar then

tar xvf packagename.tar

files get unzipped


~$ tar xvf fruitszipped.tar
apple.txt
citrus.txt


== how to rename file ==
mv oldfilename newfilename

mv apple.txt redapple.txt

== how to combine contents of two separate files into new single file==
cat file1 file2 > file3

cat apple.txt orange.txt > sweet.txt

$ cat redapple.txt orange.txt > sweet.txt
:~$ cat sweet.txt
apple is called doctor of fruit because it helps to cure diseseases.
orange is citrus family food and act like medicine to reduce heat in the body.


== how to split file using 'split' cmd==
split -l 1 filename

$ split -l 1 sweet.txt

it splitted into xaa and xab files

$ cat xaa
apple is called doctor of fruit because it helps to cure diseseases.
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ cat xab
orange is citrus family food and act like medicine to reduce heat in the body.



== how to search something in big file ==
open file using less, nano
different commands for vim, nano

== grep command / to find word and which para it belong to show in terminal ==

grep command findout word in para and showcase in terminal

cat filename | grep searchterm


$ cat bigfile.txt | grep fly

the fly term is highlighted in red in terminal

It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

=== head and tail command ===
if i want to see first lines head
if i want to see last lines tail


head -1 filename

-1 shows 1 line 

~$ head -1 sweet.txt
apple is called doctor of fruit because it helps to cure diseseases.

:~$ head -2 sweet.txt
apple is called doctor of fruit because it helps to cure diseseases.
orange is citrus family food and act like medicine to reduce heat in the body.
