19 - What is root user in linux | What is sudo in linux

root user - The root user is the default superuser account in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that has unrestricted access to all commands, files, and resources on the system. It is identified by the special User ID (UID) of 0. 

Key Characteristics
Unlimited Privileges: The root user can perform any action, including modifying system files, changing permissions, installing/removing software, managing user accounts, and formatting disks.

Security Risk: Due to its immense power, routinely operating as the root user is a significant security risk, as accidental or malicious actions can severely damage the system.

Best Practice: Modern Linux distributions recommend using a regular, unprivileged user account for daily tasks and employing specific tools like sudo to perform administrative functions when necessary.
Default State: In many distributions (like Ubuntu), the direct root login is disabled by default, and the root account may not have a password set initially. 

other users can;t make folder in root user account . or anything 

=== sudo == 

using sudo u can create dir with root permission without logged as root user

The sudo command (short for "superuser do" or "substitute user do") is a powerful utility in Unix-like operating systems that allows an authorized user to execute a command with the security privileges of another user, typically the root user. 

Purpose and Function
Privilege Elevation: The primary use of sudo is to safely perform administrative tasks without needing to log in to the powerful, unrestricted root account directly.
Security: By default, it asks for your own password, not the root password, which prevents the need to share sensitive root credentials. This also limits the elevated privileges to a single command or for a short time (typically 5 minutes), reducing the risk of accidental system damage.
Auditing: Every command run with sudo is logged, providing a clear audit trail of who performed which administrative actions. 
Basic Usage
To use sudo, simply prepend it to the command you want to run with elevated privileges: 

syntax
sudo [command]

so let's create folder with root type permission

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ sudo mkdir boxing
[sudo] password for linuxofpratham:

drwxr-xr-x  2 root           root    4.0K Dec 13 20:51 boxing

so for 15min your normal user has become root user level power so u able to create dir 

let's see what we permission of root level have 
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for linuxofpratham on Pratham:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty

User linuxofpratham may run the following commands on Pratham:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL


== let's see does other user has root permission
kayaba@Pratham:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for kayaba:
Sorry, user kayaba may not run sudo on Pratham.


let's try updating via user acc
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ apt update
Reading package lists... Done
E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
W: Problem unlinking the file /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin - RemoveCaches (13: Permission denied)
W: Problem unlinking the file /var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin - RemoveCaches (13: Permission denied)

but if sudo apt update is written

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ sudo apt update
0% [Connecting to archive.ubuntu.com (2a06:bc80:0:1000::18)] [Connecting to security.ubuntu.com (2a06:bc80:0:1000::18)]

it is working for 15min it will not ask password of root acc
