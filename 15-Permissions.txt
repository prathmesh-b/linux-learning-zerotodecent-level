d = directory/folder

drwxr-xr-x 3 linuxofpratham pratham 4.0K Oct 24 07:39 cloudcomputing

here 1st line is file txt
2nd is dir

so now remaining 9 characters after first divide into 3 parts

l rwx rwx rwx
   1   2   3

1 group rwx after 1st l denotes permission 
r= read w= write x= execute

2 group represent  group permission suppose there are A B C users on linux system 
and A and B are part of group G so permission belong to group G

3 group belongs to others and their permissison

also at position of rwx after 1st character there may be - which reperesnt no permission to r or w or x

drwxr-xr-x 3 linuxofpratham pratham 4.0K Oct 24 07:39 cloudcomputing

d rwx r-x r-x 
here r-x means user can read but not write or do changes in file but it can run/open the file
