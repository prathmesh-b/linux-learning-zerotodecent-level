Virtualisation helps you to run/test apps/software anything on different OS other than your current OS

Hypervisor Software creates virtual machines (VMs)

VM eg oracle virtual box opensource software

How Hypervisor works?
- virtual box share hardware resources from Host OS 
- Separate set of virtual CPU,RAM,Storage etc
- VMs are fully isolated (independent of hosted OS)



Host machine
(current pc 8GB RAM, 100GB HDD) ---> using Hypervisor software (VMs) ----> VM 1 Virtual Pc (2GB RAM, 20GB HDD) LINUX Installed                            ---> VM 2 Virtual pc (2GB RAM  10GB HDD)  Mac OS 

here 1pc with 8GB RAM, 100GB HDD) ---> using Hypervisor software (VMs) created ----> 2 virtual pcs which share hardware resources and run independently like pc and different OS can be installed


== Benefits of VMs ==
We don't need new resources to use different OS for testing any app on different OS
No risk of any issues with your primary OS


== Types of Hypervisor ==
Type1 (Bare Metal)     Type2 (Hosted)

Type2 (Hosted) -- we created VMs on HOST OS like on already top of present OS to run VMS using hypervisor


Type1 (Bare Metal) -- there is no host OS instead Hypervisor is directly setuped on hardware level. eg VMware vSphere/ ESXi, Xen etc and various VMs with diff OS will be runned. basic os is present in software to setup vms
- Used by Cloud Providers and Enterprise Servers. so many organisation has huge hardware which they create many VMs and use for diff purposes by various diff teams.

== Virtualisation Use Case ==
- cheap 
- reduces workload,space,energy
- easy backup using snapshot
- easy recovery
