 Linux Groups Organize Permissions


suppose there are 10 people in company who want to work on file. so what u do divide into group and give them 5 got read or 5 got write

Linux group permissions are a core part of the system's security model, controlling what members of an assigned group can do with a specific file or directory. 

Understanding Group Permissions
Every file and directory in Linux is assigned to a single owning group and has a specific set of permissions for that group. When a user tries to access a file, the system checks if they are the owner, a member of the owning group, or "other" (everyone else), and applies the corresponding permissions. 
The three basic permission types are: Read (r or 4), Write (w or 2), and Execute (x or 1). Read allows viewing contents, write allows modification, and execute allows running a file or entering a directory. 

Viewing and Changing Permissions
The ls -l command displays permissions as a 10-character string (e.g., -rwxr-xr--). The first character indicates file type, the next three are user permissions, the following three are group permissions, and the last three are for others. 

The chmod command is used to modify permissions. You can use symbols or numeric codes: 
Command 	Description
chmod g+w filename	Adds write permission for the group.
chmod g-x filename	Removes execute permission for the group.
chmod g=rw filename	Sets the group's permissions to read and write.

Numeric mode uses octal values. For instance, chmod 755 filename sets permissions for user, group, and others; the middle digit 5 (4+1) grants read and execute to the group. 

Managing Group Ownership
To change the group that owns a file or directory, use the chgrp or chown commands. 
Command 	Description
chgrp groupname filename	Changes the group ownership of a file.
chown user:groupname filename	Changes both user and group ownership.
chown -R :groupname directory	Recursively changes the group for a directory and its contents.


=============

linuxofpratham@Pratham: $ groups
pratham adm dialout cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev netdev

this shows which part of group ur current user is . there are many group because linuxofpratham is admin type user so it is part of various groups


=== addgroup ====
$ addgroup backENDTeam
addgroup: Only root may add a user or group to the system.


root@Pratham:~# addgroup backENDTeam
addgroup: Please enter a username matching the regular expression configured
via the NAME_REGEX[_SYSTEM] configuration variable.  Use the `--force-badname'
option to relax this check or reconfigure NAME_REGEX.


This error telling that your groupname does not follow rule. let's see what rule is

so last rule says
# check user and group names also against this regular expression.
#NAME_REGEX="^[a-z][-a-z0-9_]*\$"

this means your name is capital     backENDTeam         and it should be smallcase


=== adding user to group===
root@Pratham:~# adduser kayaba backendteam
Adding user `kayaba' to group `backendteam' ...
Adding user kayaba to group backendteam
Done.

now checking from kayaba acc
groups kayaba
kayaba : kayaba backendteam


so u see kayaba is part of backendteam

=====
now lets create dir of backend_project_1

root@Pratham:~# sudo mkdir backend_project_1
root@Pratham:~# ls -lha
total 36K
drwx------  5 root root 4.0K Dec 13 20:28 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4.0K Dec 13 20:08 ..
-rw-------  1 root root 1.4K Dec 13 20:24 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3.1K Oct 15  2021 .bashrc
drwx------  2 root root 4.0K Oct 22 13:44 .cache
-rw-------  1 root root   20 Dec  3 11:48 .lesshst
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 4.0K Nov  9 14:04 .local
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Dec 13 19:54 .motd_shown
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  161 Jul  9  2019 .profile
-rw-r--r--  1 root root    0 Dec 13 20:07 .sudo_as_admin_successful
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4.0K Dec 13 20:28 backend_project_1

so we created dir for backend team now i want to change owner of this backend_project_1 to someone else follow 19-rootuser and sudo explained
