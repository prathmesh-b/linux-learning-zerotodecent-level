23-Linux Environment Variables: Boost Your System's Performance!

variable specific to environment

suppose u working on project and u have some secret codes or say tokens u want your program have access to it but not other people. so then i will create that environament variable and store values in it.

whenever u start terminal session start and shell keep information and that information is called environment variable.

variable means location for storing a value, referred to with its symbolic name, the value stored can be displayed,deleted,edited and resaved.

Environment Variables has dynamic values,exist in every operating system, can be created,edited,saved and deleted. also gives information about the system behavior. change the way software/programs behave

eg $LANG enviornment variable store value of language such that if application is run then app read this variable and shows chinese to china user and en to usa people.

== how to access variable values ===

syntax
echo $VARIABLE

echo $PATH 

this variable contains a colon (:)- separated list of directories in which your system looks for executable files.


the shell look for command in dir and if it correc it shows result else not


$USER
it shows user name


env 
it prints all environment info eg user name, home pwd etc
----------------

different user will have diff env values like name and other


==== how to add new variable to system env=======
and all this env variables are being used by program to run eg lang etc


linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ export my_mail=mail@mail.com
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ env

u will see my_mail=mail@mail.com

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ echo $my_mail
mail@mail.com


so u see your new variable is ready to be used by program

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ printenv | grep mail@
my_mail=mail@mail.com

so if u do bash which means ending nested shell then env variable saved in system will be shown.
