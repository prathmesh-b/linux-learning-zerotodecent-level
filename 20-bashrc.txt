20-Mastering Bashrc in Linux: Boost Your Productivity !

you would have encounter whatever work u done of commands written it just udjate hae when u restart the terminal. but there is solution where u can save this in .bashrc

.bashrc file always run in background whenever terminal is running. so u can save it there

You can change starting line which is called prompt whenever u start terminal, but u can change the name 

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ export PS1=likhnabhai:
likhnabhai:
likhnabhai:
likhnabhai:
likhnabhai:
likhnabhai:
likhnabhai:

but if you now close terminal and restart again the prev prompt will be gone

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$

so in order to save this we can store this in .bashrc file 

so let's store prev setting we want permanently in .bashrc file

nano .bashrc

at the end we added 

---content inside .bashrc file----
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi


PS1=likhnabhai:
------------------------

so we added at last part. so in order to apply this change permanently either restart terminal or run source .bashrc

linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$ source .bashrc

this run file and apply chnages without restarting terminal

i checked and it shows
likhnabhai:


if you want to revert/delete change  overwrited file just remove this from .bashrc file

likhnabhai:source .bashrc
linuxofpratham@Pratham:~$

see we come back to default
